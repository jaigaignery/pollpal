# Pollpal

Pollpal is a full-stack polling app, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node. Pollpal is used to host polls, that people can create and share with others to gather their votes. All votes are stored in Firebase.

## Installation

A hosted version of Pollpal can be found here:

If you would like to install or inspect it on your machine you will need Git and Node.js installed.
Once you have those installed, follow these instructions:

```
# Clone the GitHub repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/jaigaignery/pollpal.git

# Navigate to your cloned directory:
$ cd pollpal

# Install the required Node.js dependencies:
$ npm install

# Run the application (runs on port 8383):
$ npm run dev
```

## Upcoming features

I am always looking to add features to and polish Pollpal. Here are some improvements I plan to make in the near future:

- CSS overhaul
- Click a hosted question to automatically copy the link to that poll
