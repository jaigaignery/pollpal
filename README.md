PollPal is a user-friendly polling app designed to simplify the process of creating and participating in polls. With PollPal, users can effortlessly create polls, share them with others, and gather opinions on any topic. The app's intuitive interface and unique URL system make it convenient for both poll creators and participants.

## Technologies Used

Pollpal makes use of various web technologies and languages to make it a seamless full-stack application. Here are the technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Google Firebase

## Key Features

- Quickly create polls with a straightforward and user-friendly interface.
- Each poll is assigned its own unique URL, ensuring easy access at any time and by anyone.
- Participants can access polls directly through the provided URL without the need for accounts or logins.
- Polls are securely stored, allowing users to revisit and analyze results over time.

## Upcoming features

I am always looking to add features to and polish Pollpal. Here are some improvements I plan to make in the near future:

- Change "Copy/Copied to clipboard" alert to tooltip
- Populate vote count based on server response, instead of adding +1 to vote count on front end and assuming successful vote POST.
- Railway hosting
